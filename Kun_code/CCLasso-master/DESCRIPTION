Note: There are some notable modifications in version 2.0.
      1. Golden section method is used for cross validation procedure.
      2. Bootstrap method is used to give more stable estimation.
      3. An artificial null correlation samples is used to adjust the 
         correlation's estimation and prove the p-values.
Acknowledges: I am indebted to Dr. Zewei Song (University of Minnesota) and 
              Dr. Ricardo Da Silva (University of California, San Diego) for 
              their generous feedbacks about the bugs that there is a tendency 
              to select too large lambda for CCLasso v1.0.
