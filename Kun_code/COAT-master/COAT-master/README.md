# Large Covariance Estimation for Compositional Data Via Composition-Adjusted Thresholding

In this repo, we address the problem of covariance estimation for high-dimensional compositional data and introduce a composition-adjusted thresholding (COAT) method under the assumption that the basis covariance matrix is sparse. Our method is based on a decomposition relating the compositional covariance to the basis covariance, which is approximately identifiable as the dimensionality tends to infinity. The resulting procedure can be viewed as thresholding the sample centered log-ratio covariance matrix and hence is scalable for large covariance matrices.
